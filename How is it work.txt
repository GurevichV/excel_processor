This program is designed for convenient work with CSV files. And for a specific task.

***Task***: creating a new file which will contain some data from the client's file and half of the data from the file 
exported from the site.

***Required data***: files must be in the same format as stored in the main folder.

***Description***: two files are compared by barcode. If the barcodes converge, then a new file is written, 
where the price, discount and dates are taken from the client's file. Barcode, special product code and name are taken 
from the website file.
